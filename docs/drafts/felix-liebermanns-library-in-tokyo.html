        <div>
            <p>Felix Liebermann (1851–1925) is known mostly for his enourmous edition of the laws written between c. 600 (in the kingdom of Kent) and c. 1200(?) in England. <em>Der Gesetze der Angelsachsen</em> came out in three volumes between 1903 and 1916, with much of the work being published in separate articles from the 1890s onwards, especially the  post-conquest translations, reworkings and adaptations of Anglo-Saxon law. Liebermann is the last editor (for now) who did an edition of all the Anglo-Saxon laws in one volume, a tradition which started with William Lambarde in the 1560s and was continued by Whelock in the 17th century, Wilkins in the 18th century and Schmid and Thorpe in the 19th century. Many texts exist in more recent editions (e.g. the early Kentish laws, the code of Alfred, Wulfstan&#8217;s laws for Æthelred and Cnut). But nothing quite rivals the convenience of having all texts printed from essentially every manuscript, like you get in <em>Gesetze</em>. Liebermann, therefore, is still our go-to for editions of the laws, despite some of the flaws of his edition. (Personally, I have to admit that I check modern editions after Liebermann. And I&#8217;m perhaps more likely to check the manuscripts before I check the modern&nbsp;editions.) </p>
<p>Liebermann&#8217;s career has been covered in several publications before [<span class="caps">REFS</span>], but the short summary is that he was a historian from a wealthy Jewish Berlin family, so wealthy that he never needed to work a paid position at a university to continue his research (though he had honorary positions at many). He was a historian of England but not, initially, Anglo-Saxon England. He did not have a degree in law, but started editing Anglo-Norman legal sources from early on in his career, which eventually led him to be commissioned to do an edition of the Anglo-Saxon laws. And editing was by far his main output. He published large amounts of material, but the vast majority are editions or source studies. He didn&#8217;t write any analytic histories of, e.g., English law, though he facilitated access to the primary source material needed to do so. There is a lot more to say about Liebermann&#8217;s life, which I will do in future&nbsp;posts.</p>
<p>For now, let&#8217;s focus on Liebermann&#8217;s library. This private collection of roughly 4–5000 items was sold after his death in 1925 to the University of Tokyo (then the Tokyo Imperial University), via the Japanese finance ministry. We don&#8217;t know exactly how this happened [fn: Sandberg and Arimitsu, no records found], but it seems to have been part of a reparations package after the First World&nbsp;War. </p>
<p><span class="caps">SEE</span> <span class="caps">THE</span> <span class="caps">LIBRARY</span> <span class="caps">BLOG</span> <span class="caps">FOR</span> <span class="caps">CONTEXT</span>&nbsp;https://u-parl.lib.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/column87 </p>
<p>There are two relevant bits of context for this: one is the destruction of the library of the University of Tokyo in the Great Kanto Earthquake of 1923 and the other were decades-long ties between Germany and Japanese scholars. The earthquake&#8217;s destruction meant that the library was in need of new books. Many were gifted to the university from nations, libraries, universities and individuals across the world. When I&#8217;m in the stacks of the General Library at the University today, a large number of books are marked as having been donated by countries around the&nbsp;world. </p>
<p>Starting in the late ninteenth century (but taking off after World War One), Japanese scholars and students made their way to Germany to study. [close connections especially in medicine, but also law &#8212; libraries of several German legal scholars/historians ended up in Japan, not all by same route]. One route was reparations &#8212; which Liebermann&nbsp;was</p>
