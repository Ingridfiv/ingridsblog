            <p>Felix Liebermann (1851–1925) was born into a wealthy Jewish family in Berlin. He grew up only metres from the Brandenburger Tor in central Berlin with his parents and three siblings, which included the famous painter Max Liebermann. His father wanted him to enter the family business in textile manufacturing, so after finishing school Felix trained at a bank in Berlin before being sent to Manchester to work in the textiles industry (1870–1872). When or how he became interested in history – English history in particular – is uncertain, though letters from his brother Max suggests he was reading history in the evenings in while working in the merchant industry [Das Liebermann-buch, 101]. On returning to Germany, and after a year’s military service, he convinced his father to let him study history. He studied history at Göttingen, including English history with Reinhold Pauli and German history with Georg Waitz. In 1875–6, he attended lectures in Berlin with, inter alia, Theodor Mommsen on Roman law and  Rudolf von Gneist on German constitutional law.[fn: Sandig, 26, 65 — has looked at school records, though Hazeltine’s obit says he was at Berlin in 1872-3]. His thesis on a twelfth-century legal text, Einleitung in den Dialogus de Scaccario, was published in 1875 and he was awarded his doctorate in January of&nbsp;1876.  </p>
<p>For the next decade or so, Liebermann worked at the Monumenta Germaniae Historica, where one of his Göttingen professors, Georg Waitz, had recently taken up the editorship. Liebermann collaborated with Reinhold Pauli on volumes 27 (1885) and 28 (1888), completing them alone after Pauli died in 1882. These volumes collected historical writings on Germany from England, and so during this time, Liebermann spent long periods in England doing manuscript work. Though mostly on the clock for the <span class="caps">MGH</span>, he also found time to do his own work, resulting in the 1879 volume Ungedruckte Anglo-normannische&nbsp;geschichtsquellen. </p>
<p>Liebermann’s early work and training was thus in history, Latin and medieval English sources.  But it seems that his real passion was for manuscript work, and so he soon turned to Anglo-Saxon sources too. In 1889, he edited the Old English and Latin texts of ‘On the resting places of saints’/Secgan and Þa halgan/The Kentish royal legend) in Die Heiligen&nbsp;Englands. </p>
<p>He then turned to his greatest work, the three-volume edition of the Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-Norman laws, Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen 1903–1916). He’d received a commission to undertake this work from the Savigny-Stiftung, at the request of Heinrich Brunner and Karl von Amira, and received an annual sum from the Royal Academy of Sciences in Munich towards this&nbsp;work. </p>
<p>This edition contains law-texts written between the seventh and twelfth centuries in Kent, Wessex and England, whether in Latin or Old English. Liebermann included almost every manuscript version of these texts, printed in parallel columns, with further variants and emendations in the apparatus. He consulted many more manuscripts than any editor of the laws before him (again spending long periods in English libraries), which resulted not only in better texts than previous editions but also in new pieces that had not been printed before. Volumes two and three consist of a glossary of words (Wörterbuch), glossary of legal concepts (Sachsglossar) and introduction to each text. Though Liebermann insisted in letters to colleagues that he was no philologist, this edition has secured his legacy as a textual&nbsp;critic. </p>
<p>Liebermann published widely on other subjects too, much of it in the form of reviews or shorter notes. In addition to English legal history, he wrote about Beowulf and other Old English poems, the history of English national assemblies, [Shakespeare, the first world war,&nbsp;etr]. </p>
<p>Liebermann was closely connected to historians both in England and in Germany. He corresponded with, for instance, William Stubbs, <span class="caps">F.W.</span> Maitland, <span class="caps">T.F.</span> Tout, H. Hazeltine and others in England, and people like Max Förster, Eduard Sievers, Alois Brandl, Heinrich Brunner and Edward Schröder.   He received articles and books from scholars like <span class="caps">F.L.</span> Attenborough, <span class="caps">H.M.</span> Chadwick, Maitland, John Earle, Bernard Fehr, E. Freeman, Imelmann, W. Levison, Morsbach, Napier, Frederick Pollock, Kenneth Sisam, Walter Skeat, <span class="caps">WH</span> Stevenson. [<span class="caps">ADD</span> <span class="caps">MORE</span> <span class="caps">NON</span> <span class="caps">OE</span> <span class="caps">PEOPLE</span>]</p>
<p>He seems to have played a role as mediator between English scholarship and German scholars. For instance, he wrote several long articles summarising recent work in English history for German journals and advising German scholars on manuscript work in England and Ireland. He received letters with questions on all aspects of Old English texts and English history and wrote long letters in reply. Liebermann championed the work of English legal historians like Stubbs, Maitland and Tout in Germany and lamented the ignorance of German scholarship in England. When Alois Brandl concluded his obituary of Liebermann with the question “Wie wird es jetzt unseren altenglischen Studien ergehen?”, it might well refer to his role in disseminating knowledge through letters, reviews and private conversations in his home in&nbsp;Bendlerstrasse. </p>
<p>Liebermann was given the title of Professor by the Prussian government in 1896 and held honorary degrees at Oxford, Cambridge, and Göttingen [and was a member of the British Academy and Royal Historical Society as well as corresponding member in Münchener Akademie] though he never worked at a university. According to an obituary, this was because of a slight speech impediment, though it’s worth bearing in mind how difficult it could be for Jewish academics to get positions in German universities at this time. His letters and library reveals a great interest in teaching history as a topic – for instance, Liebermann has underlined and annotated an article which sets out the practicalities of lecturing in history (should you have notes, how quickly should you speak and so on). Perhaps he supervised informally, for Frank Zinkeisen addressed Liebermann as his ‘geschätzten Lehrer’ in a handwritten inscription in the copy of his dissertation (Die Anfänge der Lehngerichtsbarkeit in England, 1893) which he sent to&nbsp;Liebermann.</p>
<p>In another letter, he laments not having support and discussions with colleagues that a university position would&nbsp;offer. </p>
<p>Not only did his wealth make it possible for Felix to continue his academic work in the absence of a university position, but it also offered him a rich life in other&nbsp;ways. </p>
<p>In a note about Felix in <em>Wer ist&#8217;s</em> of 1905, he(?) describes his three favourite pastimes as ‘Lesen schöner Litteratur, Sehen von Kunst, Fürsorge für Arme.’
[fn&nbsp;https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_SuASAAAAYAAJ/page/812/mode/2up]</p>
<p>Liebermann also had a separate life from his academic interest, filled with philanthropy, work for Jewish organisations and a keen interest in politics and social policy. He donated a lot of money to charities, including for a children’s hospital, orphanage and to support Jewish students. With his siblings, he set up Louis Liebermann Stiftung für die Armen Berlins after their father’s death in 1894 and with his wife Cäcilie he started a charitable foundation in ????. He also donated big sums to the war support fund during the first world war. He was also involved in the running of the Zunz-Stiftung zur Förderung und Ausbreitung der Wissenschaft des Judentums and was chairman of the Salomon-Neumann-Stiftung fur die Wissenschaft des Judentums. He wrote for Jewish magazines and [was interested in furthering work on Jewish history]. Several memorials of Liebermann notes that he was proud of his Jewish identity, though that he was uninterested in religious disputes. Geiger, in a tribute to Liebermann on his sixtieth birthday, wrote that “While he lived according to traditional precepts out of respect for his parents and in-laws, he always maintained his own independent views on the nature and development of the&nbsp;religion.”</p>
<p>His library reveals that he read widely on current political and social issues, especially in Germany, including many of the books and pamphlets issued by the Gesellschaft für Soziale Reform. In his youth, he described himself as a National Liberal [letter to Paul de Lagarde]. [He was pro wealth tax]. But he rarely seems to discuss party politics later on in letters or&nbsp;reviews. </p>
<p>The first world war was a disaster for Liebermann as a scholar and person. Not only was he cut off from his colleagues and friends in England, but he was also bitter and resentful at their attitudes and, in general, at the hatred towards Germany found in England and the English press. He fully supported Germany’s efforts, joining his fellow countrymen in blaming England for the outbreak of war. However, unlike many of his academic colleagues and his brother, Felix never signed the ‘Manifesto of the 93’ in October 1914, believing it to be inopportune. To his chagrin, the English press had apparently reported that he did, and he consequently lost more friends over that too. [fn to&nbsp;letter]</p>
<p>He alienated more of his British colleagues with his dedication in the third volume of Gesetze, which says ?????. He was struck off as a member of the Royal Historical Society, and refused to be reinstated after the war because he felt the treatment so&nbsp;unjust.</p>
<p>He mentions in a letter that he signed up to help the war effort as soon as the war broke out, but he was not called upon until 1916 when he was set to extract information from British weekly, fortnightly and quarterly publications. He mentions that this work kept him from his academic work, though elsewhere he describes being too depressed to work. However, he did keep up his reading and continued to write, especially book&nbsp;reviews. </p>
<p>His library contains many war-time pamphlets written by German academics, which Liebermann underlined and annotated heavily. Liebermann himself published in non-academic journals about the war and expressed his opinions frequently in academic journals through reviews of books about the war or books about England written in Germany during the&nbsp;war. </p>
<p>After the war, he resumed correspondence with a few English historians, including George Prothero and Tout, though the relationships seem rather strained. Nevertheless, after his death in 1925, several very positive obituaries appeared from British scholars. And towards the end of his life, he continued to publish on English literature and history, including Beowulf, the canons of Theodore, Nennius and medieval political&nbsp;history. </p>
<p>On 7th October 1925, Felix Liebermann was hit by a car outside his home and died a few hours&nbsp;later. </p>
