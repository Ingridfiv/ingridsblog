        <div>
            <p>The contents of Libermann&#8217;s library gives an insight into the intellectual formation of a nineteenth-century medieval historian and editor – though as I described in a previous post [link] a lot of it is&nbsp;unsurprising. </p>
<p>Thankfully, Liebermann was an avid note-taker, and so we don&#8217;t just have access to what read but also what he thought about (some of) what he read. And some books have other little bits of evidence for his life and&nbsp;thoughts. </p>
<p>A handful of books are so heavily annotated that I&#8217;m surprised the University of Tokyo even wanted them for their general collection. Unfortunately getting permission to take and publish pictures is quite the process here in Tokyo, but hopefully I will be able to put some pictures up soon, because it it is quite the sight. Two series of books stand out: Lappenberg and Pauli&#8217;s ?? volumes of <em>Geschichte von England</em> and Hardy&#8217;s <em>Descriptive catalogue of materials relating to the history of Great Britain and Ireland</em>. In both books there are pages that have more of Liebermann&#8217;s notes than printed&nbsp;text. </p>
<p>Lappenberg and Pauli seems to have been used by Liebermann during his degrees and later to learn the history of England. Writes timelines and fills in family trees&nbsp;etr. </p>
<p>In Hardy, all kinds of notes but includes filling in from <span class="caps">MSS</span> (I think), extra text, further content in <span class="caps">MSS</span>, and so on. THe entire catalogue is full on <span class="caps">FL</span>&#8217;s own&nbsp;text.</p>
<p>There is also a full set of Liebermann&#8217;s edition of the Anglo-Saxon laws. Volume 2 has been rebound so that every other page is blank. To varying degrees, these blank pages have been filled with Liebermann&#8217;s notes. Unfortunately, all three volumes (in five? parts) were rebound when they got to Tokyo and as part of this process the pages were cut. So many notes are cut&nbsp;through. </p>
<p>These notes are, frankly, not that interesting. The notes in volume 1 are corrections, addition variants from a Latin manuscript only found after the making of the first volume and additional notes. Almost all the notes in volume 1 seem to have been incorporated into Volume 2 or 3 (which came out nine and thirteen years after Volume 1). The notes in volume 2 are for the most part <span class="caps">MORE</span> <span class="caps">INFORMATION</span>. Further references to primary and secondary sources. Additional entries (in the Sachsglossar, each entry has numbered paragraphs. He adds new ones). The notes in Volume 3 make less sense, in that there were no further volumes planned, so unlike the notes in Vols 1 and 2, he would have no chance to incorporate these into future volumes. They are also, in general, much more neatly written (almost all in pen, pencil more common in vol 1). It almost looks like he took into consideration that they might be read by others, rather than being working notes for&nbsp;himself. </p>
<p>He seems to have kept adding notes to his volumes. Some date as late as 1925, the year of his death. He has added a note to a story from [?The Spectator] from 1917, presumably something he came across when he was tasked by the German war office with excerpting (and translating) British newspapers around 1917. [see post on <span class="caps">WWI</span> &#8212; he has several other excerpts from British papers in his letters and publications(?) at this time, totally unrelated to&nbsp;war.]</p>
<p>Lots of other books have notes too. Some that stand out are the notes in books about politics, current affairs and the war. Liebermann here often seems to take notes when he disagrees. [<span class="caps">EXAMPLES</span>]
E.g. in Preuss&#8217; Obrigkeitsstaat, where <span class="caps">FL</span> disagrees with benefits of parliamentary system in England &#8212; &#8220;Wird etwa beim Parlamentarismus der Tüchtigste gewählt? Doch meist nur der beste agitator oder der Kandidat der herrschenden partei oder Clique&#8221;. On something about Bismarck &#8212; ‘Welch Hirngespinst!’ &#8212; in Heldmann, Zwei&nbsp;Menschenalter.   </p>
<p>lot of the war books/contemporary politics &#8212; often disagrees and writes out his reseasons in the margins. Often a lot. Sometimes just loads of questions marks in the margins. This is f.ex. in Houston Chamberlaine &#8212; where he seems to have disagreed (or questioned) lots of it (and that&#8217;s also clear from when he discusses <span class="caps">HC</span> in the article &#8216;Wenn ich neutraler ware&#8217;). He also had lots of ? and ?! in Sisam&#8217;s article on Lambarde. Sisam sent <span class="caps">FL</span> this article a month before he died &#8212; he clearly read it carefully, disagreed, but died before he could write anything about&nbsp;it. </p>
<p>Thorpe&#8217;s edition of the <span class="caps">AS</span> laws is also an interesting use of books. Clearly <span class="caps">FL</span> sent off parts to someone at the <span class="caps">BL</span> who collated with other <span class="caps">MS</span> of the texts that Thorpe hadn&#8217;t used. <span class="caps">FL</span> wrote questions and comments in the text, the person collating wrote answers and all variants etr. Other editions also have variants and corrections in <span class="caps">FL</span>&#8217;s&nbsp;hand. </p>
<p>Letters: short
Lending to book to <span class="caps">POW</span>
Zinkeisen obit and letter
inserted slips from meetings, library notes
books reviews etr (in Ungedruckte)
Books he received from others (see post on letters)
Papers for the AMerican historical congress 1914 &#8212; marked as a &#8216;Tract. belli&#8217;
Also habit, as he mentions in a letter, of underlining in books. Lots of question marks too (sometimes accompanied with notes in his hand, other times not. But clearly&nbsp;him)</p>
