        <div>
            <p>Anglo-Saxon law has a lot to offer. The grandiose laws of Alfred – with their translation of biblical law – give us room for endless commentary about kings, God and politics in the ninth century. The homiletic laws penned by Archbishop Wulfstan for Kings Æthelred and Cnut show us a period in which law and good order was seen as closely connected to society&#8217;s fortunes in the face of viking attacks. And all law texts – from Æthelberht’s in the seventh century to Cnut’s in the eleventh – reveal rules, legal principles and procedures as well as aspects of daily life in England. They are used actively and enthusiastically by all scholars of the early Middle Ages in&nbsp;England. </p>
<p>Some texts are, however, harder to make sense of than others. We know so little about them – when they were made, what the originals looked like, why they were composed and by whom – that using them as evidence is almost impossible. Those that can be dated are shrouded in mystery in other ways (<span class="caps">IV</span> Edgar in Latin); and those with a seemingly more obvious purpose (<span class="caps">II</span> Atr App) can’t be dated or reconstructed into their original form. Some of these texts have been unlucky in their editorial names – Alfred-Guthrum Appendix, <span class="caps">II</span> Æthelred Appendix – which they were given during the nineteenth century. And others have been relegated to marginal positions in their editions (<span class="caps">IV</span> Edgar Latin) or overlooked by translators. They are, however, useful texts. They show us what was possible but rarely done when writing law-texts, they show us legal minds at work and they reveal the blurry edges of the genre of the Anglo-Saxon&nbsp;law.</p>
<p><strong>The ‘Appendices’&nbsp;Texts</strong></p>
<p>Two texts have fascinated me, though we know little about them: &#8216;Alfred-Guthrum Appendix&#8217; and &#8216;<span class="caps">II</span> Æthelred Appendix&#8217;. Perhaps Liebermann’s [Schmidt’s?] uninspiring names have kept scholars away.<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> In fact, &#8216;Alfred-Guthrum Appendix&#8217; is perhaps the gravest example of a mismatch between an editorial name and the actual status of a text, because it is not an appendix nor originally associated with Alfred or Guthrum or their joint&nbsp;treaty. </p>
<p>More importantly, it is a unique example of a tract on a single topic of law compiled from various Anglo-Saxon decrees, in this case theft. It contains extracts from the laws of Ine, Edward, Æthelstan and Edmund<sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> on the topic of theft and rights and responsibilities in the justice system. The fact that it only survives as a translation in Quadripartitus – the twelfth-century translation into Latin of most Anglo-Saxon laws – means that the original is hidden from view. Nevertheless, the text is so close in wording to its sources that the original seems to have been made by copying clauses from the actual texts of Ine, Edward, Æthelstan and Edmund’s&nbsp;laws. </p>
<p>This ‘compilation on theft’ is chronologically ordered and based primarily on Ine and <span class="caps">II</span> Æthelstan. The first half consists mainly in extracts from Ine, which are (as far as we can tell) copied almost exactly as they appear in Alfred-Ine. The following extracts from <span class="caps">II</span> Æthelstan are treated more flexibly, with the compiler changing some words, adding detail and combining separate sentences. Lines from <span class="caps">II</span> Edward and <span class="caps">III</span> Edmund make occasional appearances, but seemingly only to add detail missing from the other&nbsp;sources. </p>
<p>The existence of this text suggests several things: there may have been people interested in law in an [intellectual/abstract] way – or the history and development of law. Someone with a specialist interest – no legal profession, but could suggest that those who operated as judges or advocates studied. There may have been a use for tracts on single subjects, perhaps in court. There will have been people with access to law texts from different&nbsp;periods. </p>
<p>So while this text contains clauses we already know from the original royal decrees from which they were taken, this text can show us a different part of the legal system than the standard royal decrees do. Other texts in this vein are already known, for instance Wulfstan&#8217;s tracts and Wer/Ordal. AGu App adds to the picture suggested by these texts, but with the additional aspect of it using old texts and compiling, which suggests access to and interest in old&nbsp;law. </p>
<p>The second text, &#8216;<span class="caps">II</span> Æthelred Appendix&#8217; (<span class="caps">II</span> Atr App), is not part of <span class="caps">II</span> Æthelred.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> Again we see a misleading name hide an intriguing text. This text displays an almost unique concern for principles in the Anglo-Saxon legal corpus, offering a rare combination of procedural rules and juristic maxims. Overall, it is a detailed exposition of the practice of vouching to warranty,<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> covering the basic process (<span class="caps">II</span> Atr App 8, 8.3, 9.1), practicalities of getting the warrantor (8.1, 8.3), the location of the process (8.4, 9), cases where a warrantor has died (9.2, 9.3) and other ways of proving ownership (9.4). These run-of-the-mill regulations are often followed by unusually pithy summaries, such as ‘forðam a bið andsæc swiðere ðonne onsagu’ (‘because a denial is always stronger than an accusation’; <span class="caps">II</span> Atr App 9.3); ‘swunce mare se ðe þæt unriht gestreon on his handa stode ⁊ læsse se ðe ðær ariht onspræce’ (‘the trouble [should be] greater for he who stood with the unlawful gain in his hand and less for he who there claimed it rightly’; <span class="caps">II</span> Atr App 9); and ‘forðam agnung bið ner ðam ðe hæfð ðonne ðam ðe æftersprecð’ (‘because ownership is nearer to he who has than he who claims’; <span class="caps">II</span> Atr App 9.4).<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5">5</a></sup> Another chapter summarizes the principle behind the&nbsp;foregoing:</p>
<p>Gif he cenne ofer I scira, hæbbe I wucena fyrst; gif he cenne ofer <span class="caps">II</span> scira, hæbbe <span class="caps">II</span> wucena fyrst; gyf he cenna ofer <span class="caps">III</span> scira, hæbbe <span class="caps">III</span> wucena fyrst: ofor eallswa fela scira swa he cenne, hæbbe swa fela wycena fyrst. (<span class="caps">IV</span> Eg&nbsp;8.3)</p>
<p>If he can specify the county in which the man whom he vouches to warranty lives, he shall have a week’s adjournment; if he can locate him within two counties, he shall have two weeks; if within three, he shall have three weeks. The number of weeks’ adjournment granted him shall correspond to the number of counties which he names.<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6">6</a></sup> </p>
<p>This might not sound like much to people used to other legislative traditions (medieval or modern), but Anglo-Saxon legislation almost never includes general statements like this. In Anglo-Saxon written law we would certainly expect to see something like the first part of this clause (&#8216;if one county, then one week&#8217;s adjournment..&#8217;) but not the second (&#8216;number of week&#8217;s adjournment correspond with number of&nbsp;counties). </p>
<p>Perhaps the details, the summaries and the maxims mean that the text was written by someone with a specialist interest in the topic of vouching beyond practical knowledge of current practice. The attempts at covering all eventualities could be the result of thinking through the application of a law, and the summaries could be the written manifestation of such thinking. This specialist interest could also be also betrayed by a passage that starts <em>hwilon stod</em> (‘it used to be’) and which then goes on to explain ‘þa geræddan witan þæt hit betere wære þæt’ (‘then the witan decided that it would be better that’). Such an explicit reference to legal change is almost as rare as the legal maxims.<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7">7</a></sup> </p>
<p><span class="caps">NB</span>! Fonthill – Helmstan is ‘nearer the oath’ than Æthelhelm, Helmstan has charters for sales/ownership of land and so is nearer [Keynes, ‘Fonthill Letter’ 71-3 points out connections Fonthill/<span class="caps">II</span> Atr&nbsp;App]</p>

<p>Wormald does, of course, give both texts a bit of attention: <em>The Making of English Law</em> (<span class="caps">MEL</span>), Vol I, p. 321, 379–80.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Both Liebermann and Wormald took the laws of Edmund to be the latest included in AGu App (Wormald, <span class="caps">MEL</span>, p. 380, fn 520 and Liebermann, <em>Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen</em>, Vol <span class="caps">III</span>, p. 233). However, it seems to me that the first part of AGu App 5 could be adapted from <span class="caps">III</span> Eg 6. The wording is slightly different and so perhaps it is from a lost source, which Edgar later used too, or merely a coincidence. At any rate, I think the <span class="caps">III</span> Eg connection (or a lost source) is more reasonable than Liebermann’s suggestion of Af 34, which is on a different topic entirely.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Liebermann noted that <span class="caps">II</span> Atr App is a separate text, though he retained the ‘appendix’ name; Liebermann, <em>Die Gesetze der Angelsachsen</em>, Vol <span class="caps">III</span>, p. 155. Both Wormald and Liebermann argued that it was a fragment (Wormald, <span class="caps">MEL</span>, pp. 321, 370 and Liebermann, Gesetze <span class="caps">III</span>, p. 155), though I don’t see any reason why this must be the case.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:3" title="Jump back to footnote 3 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>This is what&#8217;s known as <em>team</em> in Old English and can be explained as follows: &#8220;the process of establishing title to moveable goods by vouching to warranty the person from whom they had been obtained; the right to revenues arising from such pleas, and sometimes of jurisdiction over them.&#8221; https://clicme.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/encyc/level1/#Vlink&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>The only similar expressions elsewhere in the corpus are found in Ine’s laws on trees, which state that ‘forþamþe fyr bið þeof’ (‘because fire is a thief’; Ine 43) and ‘forþon sio æsc bið melda, nalles ðeof’ (‘because an axe is an informer, not at all a thief’; Ine 43.1).&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:5" title="Jump back to footnote 5 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

<p>Forfang 2–3 also describes a legal change using similar words. Two Wulfstan tracts make references to old and current law: Geþyncðu 1 and Grið 3, 22. There are a number of other tracts attributable to Wulfstan, namely Norðleoda laga, Mircna laga, Að and Hadbot, which concern status and compensation, except for Grið, which is on church peace.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:7" title="Jump back to footnote 7 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>

We know nothing about their circumstances or date and they usually only survive in single copies. But these texts are worth looking at, because they show us a different kind of legislation from royal law. This is a brief introduction to some such texts."
