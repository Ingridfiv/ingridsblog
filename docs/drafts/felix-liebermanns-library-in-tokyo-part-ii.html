        <div>
            <p>My spreadsheet of Liebermann&#8217;s library currently has 2648 entries. Some entries have many volumes, so the total currently accounted for is roughly around 4200. This includes books, journals and reprints of&nbsp;articles. </p>
<p>A catalogue made in 1937 has 1989 entries and the final entry of this catalogue reads &#8216;Pamphlets 1762 volumes&#8217;. This refers mostly to reprints of articles, which are bound individually as booklets, but were not catalogued individually. The online catalogue of the University Library has accounted for 300 of these and I have found an additional 311 (as of October 17) – though I&#8217;m still searching for more every day! But this means that there should be another 1000+ pamphlets. This means that the total count should be around&nbsp;5200.</p>
<p>The online catalogue of the University of Tokyo currently lists 1421 entries (some of which have multiple volumes) belonging to the Liebermann catalogue. This includes many, but not all, items included the 1937 print catalogue as well c. 300 of the pamphlets. For anyone interested, it can be searched <a href="https://opac.dl.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/opac/opac_search/?lang=1">here</a>, by going to &#8216;Advanced Search&#8217; and choosing &#8216;Liebermann Collection&#8217; from the &#8216;Collections&#8217; tab under &#8216;Search Options&#8217;. But note that this includes only about half of what I have found. I&#8217;ll make my catalogue available when it&#8217;s done (or when I leave Tokyo in six&nbsp;months). </p>
<p>Of the identified books, there are around 600(?) pamphlets and ???&nbsp;books. </p>
<p>How to identify: printed catalogue, <span class="caps">OPAC</span> catalogue. Stamps from financial ministry in everything. Bunko stamps in lots. <span class="caps">FL</span> himself also put his name or stamp in most books, though sometimes only a category. A small group of books only have the financial ministry stamp, but I am choosing to believe that this process was accurate at the time. And ?several of these have unmistakable <span class="caps">FL</span>&nbsp;notes. </p>
<p>I have tried to categorize&nbsp;everything. </p>
<p>There is obviously a lot of history, both primary sources (medieval and ancient) and&nbsp;secondary. </p>
<p>Lots of rare books: the oldest book in his collection is from the ?1450s. He has first editions of all the previous edition of Anglo-Saxon laws, that is Lambarde, Whelock, Wilkings, Schmid and Thorpe. There are ??? books which must have been collectors&#8217; items rather than working books for his historical&nbsp;research. </p>
<p>There are loads of primary sources, ??tempted to say there are more ancient than&nbsp;Anglo-Saxon. </p>
<p>Not as many language books as I might have expected &#8212; there are grammars and dictionaries, but few books on linguistics/philology. Even though many see him as a ?philologist – or at least that his results were as important for language as for law or history (see e.g. Maitland lettter) – <span class="caps">FL</span> himself did not see himself as a philologist, but firmly a historian (as he says in several&nbsp;letters). </p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t seem to read that much &#8220;Germanicist&#8221; stuff, not very much on the other early medieval laws. Some stuff in this category, e.g. Steenstrup&#8217;s danske folkeviser (but this was sent to <span class="caps">FL</span> by Steenstrup). Gomme on the village community is very Indo-European – but <span class="caps">FL</span> seems to disagree with a lot of&nbsp;it. </p>
<p>Mostly books in German and English, a few in French and then some Norwegian and Danish, one Hungarian(!) and some&nbsp;others. </p>
<p>Most of it is unsurprising. But also lots of things on current affairs, social policy, <span class="caps">WWI</span> pamphlets &#8212; surprising only in as much as <span class="caps">FL</span>&#8217;s historical writing is not political, unlike the previous generations of German historians of England (and in England), who more often included explicit lessons for their own&nbsp;day. </p>
<p><span class="caps">FL</span> also seems to have been interested in teaching; in philosophy(?), Jewish history, modern history. A lot of geography (maps, descriptions etr) and more on social and cultural history than I had expected (e.g. on homes, clothes&nbsp;etr)</p>
<p>NOteworthy things
    the one on pine trees (Magnus Werner) and Hungarian one (use to discuss indiscriminate sending of articles among German academics)
    his own copies of Gesetze &#8212; perhaps a separate post?
    Mildly interesting that most of the pages of Green&#8217;s Conquest of England are uncut
    a book on physiology, on astronomy,&nbsp;chemistry?</p>
