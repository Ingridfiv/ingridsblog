Summary: What is in Felix Liebermann's library?
Status: draft


My spreadsheet of Liebermann's library currently has c. 2600 entries. Some entries have many volumes, so the total currently accounted for is roughly around 4200. This includes books, journals and reprints of articles. 

A catalogue made in 1937 has 1989 entries and the final entry of this catalogue reads 'Pamphlets 1762 volumes'. This refers mostly to reprints of articles, which are bound individually as booklets, but were not catalogued individually. The online catalogue of the University Library has accounted for 300 of these and I have found an additional 300 â€“ though I'm still searching for more every day! But this means that there should be another 1000+ pamphlets. This means that the total count should be around 5200.

The online catalogue of the University of Tokyo currently lists 1421 entries (some of which have multiple volumes) belonging to the Liebermann catalogue. This includes many, but not all, items included the 1937 print catalogue as well some of the pamphlets. For anyone interested, it can be searched [here](https://opac.dl.itc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/opac/opac_search/?lang=1), going to 'Advanced Search' and choosing 'Liebermann Collection' from the 'Collections' tab under 'Search Options'. But note that this includes only about half of what I have found. I'll make my catalogue available when it's done (or when I leave Tokyo in six months).
