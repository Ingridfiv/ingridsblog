Title: About

I’m Ingrid Ivarsen. Right now I work at the University of Tokyo as a visiting researcher. I don’t really fancy staying in academia, but I thought it was a shame not to share some of the unpublished research (and translations) I have. And it turns out that when you no longer take part in the system where official publications are the currency, there are easier and quicker ways to share your research! So here are some of the thoughts and ideas I’ve had over the last eight years, mostly on Anglo-Saxon law. It’s not necessarily aimed at an expert audience, but it’s not an introduction to medieval history either. (Though I'm working on a more accessible introduction to Anglo-Saxon law, so that might change!)
