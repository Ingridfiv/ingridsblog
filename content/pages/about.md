Title: About

I’m Ingrid Ivarsen. Right now I work at the University of Tokyo as a visiting researcher exploring the library of Felix Liebermann, a 19th-century editor of Anglo-Saxon law. 

Most of my work until now has, however, been on the Anglo-Saxon laws themselves. Some of it is published, but lots of it isn't. Since I don’t really fancy staying in academia, I don't see the need to publish it formally. So here are some of the thoughts and ideas I’ve had over the last eight years. It’s not necessarily aimed at an expert audience, but it’s not an introduction to medieval history either. (Though I'm working on a more accessible introduction to Anglo-Saxon law, so that might change!)
