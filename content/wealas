Summary: Criticizing historians' use of 'English' and 'Welsh' in Ine's laws as evidence

The laws of the West Saxon king Ine (r. 688–726) are irresistible. They’re not the earliest laws we have, but they are much more revealing than any of the other seventh-century laws from the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. I think few people are immediately taken with the dreary procedural offences in *Hlothhere & Eadric* (issued in the 680s) or the church-council-esque decree of King Wihtræd (695). Of course, the earliest surviving law-text, *Æthelberht*, is fascinating, but mostly because of what it hides. And for some of us, there are just too many unknowns. 

But that is not the case with *Ine*! Where Æthelberht’s laws never even mention that king (only later attributions allow us to assume they are his), Ine’s laws mention real people (known from other sources) and the circumstances of its making (albeit bare bones). 

And where *Æthelberht* is telegraphic, cryptic, gnomic, *Ine* combines some of the legalese of *Hlothhere* (i.e. giving us legal details) with evocative images of the seventh century. As historians, we feel like we can actually do something with clauses like these:

>Ðonne mon beam on wuda forbærne 7 weorðe yppe on þone ðe hit dyde, gielde he fulwite: geselle LX scill.; forþamþe fyr bið þeof. Gif mon afelle on wuda wel monega treowa, 7 wyrð eft undierne, forgielde III treowu ælc mid XXX scill.. Ne ðearf he hiora ma geldan, wære hiora swa fela swa hiora wære: forþon sio æsc bið melda, nalles ðeo. [Ine 43–43.1] 
>
>When someone burns a tree in the woods and it should become known who did it, he should pay the full fine, he should give 60 shillings, because fire is a thief. If someone should fell many trees in the woods and it afterwards became uncovered, he should pay for three trees each with 30 shillings. He does not need to pay more, be they as many as they are, because the axe is an informer, not at all a thief.

Not only does it potentially reveal something about the lives of normal people and things like the value of raw materials, but it also gives us enough legal detail to say something about compensation practices, liability and so on. And on top of that, we get some rare legal maxims, poetic but still clear.  

So, if you want to know something about families, food, farming, slavery, guilds, taxation, ordeals, money or social structures in seventh-century Wessex, look to *Ine*.  

But we really have to show much more restraint in the way we deal with this evidence. 

This is because *Ine* – although it presents itself as an Old English law-text from the seventh century – may be a ninth-century translation into Old English from a seventh-century Latin original and the original appears to be influenced by continental models.[^1] Even those who disagree with this theory of mine must be more cautious – the text of Ine’s laws has been passed down to us in a way that should make anyone suspicious and it has so many *odd* oddities (not like your normal Anglo-Saxon oddities). Relying on words and phrases from *Ine* is therefore problematic (general sense less so). No case is better to illustrate the problems than that of ethnicity.
