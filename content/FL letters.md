Summary: the things I've learnt from letters sent to and from Liebermann
Status: draft


Sadly, the Liebermann library doesn't seem to have any of his personal papers – apart from a few postcards and letters stuck into books (more on that later). This means that there is no archive, no Nachlass, of Liebermann's, and none of the (presumably many) letters sent to Liebermann by his colleagues. We can only get a glimpse of his correspondence and network through his own letters, which are lie scattered in the archives of his correspondents. I have this far identified 83 letters sent by Liebermann and 19 received by him. I have looked at over 60 of Liebermann's letters and all of the ones received by him. (The remaining ones should be available, but some libraries just charged too much for pictures, so I will have to wait till I go to Germany some day). I suspect there are more, but the only way to find them (at least the non-German ones) is to look through the papers of likely correspondents, which I can't do from Tokyo. 

But the letters have been a real pleasure! Some are, as ?Hazeltine noted in his obituary of Liebermann, indistinguishable from one of his 'Miszellen' articles, i.e. they are full of notes about manuscript variants and occurrences of words and so on. But many of them are personal and have been very good sources to his life. And I am starting to feel like I know the man – a very odd feeling for a medieval historian. 



Also: have a long list of books and articles sent to FL from his colleages and friends. Ca 150 individuals.
