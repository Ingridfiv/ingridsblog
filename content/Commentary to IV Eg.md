Summary: Commentary to the translation from Old English into Latin(?) of IV Edgar. 
Status: draft


NBNBNB! Remember to update all translations of the Latin


Intensification, ornamentation, exhortative additions
The differences can be broadly classified as exhortative additions, changes in subject (grammatical?), and omissions. 

The exhortative additions are most noticeable. Compare the following in Old English and Latin [IV Eg 1.2]:

>wen is þæt þæs hlafordes grama to ðan swiðe weaxe, þæt he him ne unne naðer ne æhta ne lifes.
>it is to be expected that the anger of the lord should grow so much that he would not allow him neither possessions or life.

>credendum procol dubio flammam indignationis domini adversus huiusmodi hominem in tantum accendi debere, ut nec illum aliqua possessione nec etiam vita dignium existimet esse.
>[it is] undoubtedly to be believed that the flame of the lord’s indignation against such men is rightly kindled to such a degree that he is considered to be unworthy of any possessions or even life.


There are other places where the Latin expands and intensifies, but keeps the meaning and basic sentence pattern, etr, for instance in 1.7: adds ‘for the salvation of our souls, live irreproachably, chastely and holily, just as befits God’s servants’

Minor additions: IV Eg 2, where the Latin text adds a reference to the Holy Trinity. 

Other (meaningless) additions: ‘renowned king Eg’ in prol; ‘which is not allowed to pass’ 1.1; ‘those in the middle’ 1.4; 8 Latin adds ‘a cow or lamb or any other kind’ to ‘living animal’; 8.1 Latin adds ‘days or’ to OE ‘night’; 8.1 Latin states explicitly that the animal is divided into two before being shared; 

Maybe has legal meaning: 2.2 Latin expands ‘rights’ by which people own things to state ‘hereditary or lawful right’; 6 Latin adds ‘with human necessity demanding’ to clause on trading with witnesses [usus necessitas, a legal expression]; 6.2. OE says ‘2 or 3’ witnesses and Latin says 2; 8.1 Latin specifies that the hundred holds half the animal without any challenges; 9: OE says animal remains undeclared but Latin says concealed; same clause OE specifies that the shepherds can’t seeks sanctuary and this is omitted by the Latin; ??11: Latin translates ‘with the right of swearing’ instead of ‘under witness’ [but check translations for this]


IV Edgar in Latin also differs in that it quotes a source directly, and both the sense and words of this passage is entirely lacking in the Old English version. The quotation is found in a longer passage on cattle theft and trade, and goes: ‘in verticem ipsius iniquitas eius convertatur’ (IV Eg Lat 11). This line is a version of Psalm 7:17 and is inserted after the death penalty is prescribed for someone who has been caught lying about purchasing under witness

CHANGES from focus on king to focus not on king

 are accompanied by more significant changes in meaning, such as the following change in focus from the king to God [IV Eg 14.1–2]

>Þonne wille ic þæt symble mid eow gehealden sy þæt ge to friþes bote gecoren hæfdon mid miclum wisdome 7 me swyðe gecwemlice. 7 þes eaca sy us eallum gemæne, þe on þissum iglandum wuniað.
>Then I wish that those things which you have chosen for the betterment of peace, with great wisdom and which are very pleasing to me, should be kept among you forever. And this addition is common to all of us who live on this island.

>Placet etiam ut hoc pactum inconcussum et inviolabile in reliquum tempus conservetur ad pacis abundantiam Deoque, omnium saluatori, ad laudem et magnificentiam et nobis omnibus in hac terrena peregrinatione degentibus ad vite longinquitatem nostrorumque peccaminum abolitionem et remissionem.
> It is also pleasing that this agreement should be kept unchallenged and uninfringed in the future, for the abundance of peace and for praise and glory to God, saviour of all, and for great length of life for all of us spending time on this earthly journey and for the abolition and remission of our sins.

A similar change occurs where the Old English reads me to fullum cynescipe ‘for my full royal dignity’, which the Latin renders as ad immense maiestatis gloriam et honorem ‘for the glory and honour of the immense majesty’, seemingly a reference to God rather than the king (IV Eg Lat 2). Similar changes of person are found elsewhere too, and they are characterised by either removing references to the king’s advisors (IV Eg Lat 1.4, 2.1a, 14) or change from the king speaking in the first person to impersonal third person verbs (1.5, 1.8, 14.1). The king is, however, still present in the Latin version, though he receives less overall attention than in the Old English (see e.g. IV Eg Lat 2, 2a, 14.1, 1.5, 1.8, 2.1a). This is sometimes because of omissions, for instance the removal of the phrase ‘I shall have the rights of my kingship’ (IV Eg 2a) from the Latin or the removal of a reference to lay interference in clerical discipline (IV Eg 1.8) [As pointed out by Whitelock EHD, p. 439 fn 3. OE: ‘And I and my thegns should compel our priests…’ to not disobey bishops; Lat. ‘let these people listen diligently… to… bishops’]

But in 2.1/2.1a, the Latin does draw more attention to king, in saying that ‘that which our kingly excellence confirmed with a general council’ as opposed to ‘I and my witan have ….’



DANELAW
Other omissions suggest, as Whitelock argued, that there was an attempt to shift away from the original’s focus on the northern Danelaw.
Latin omits 12: Danes choose good law for themselves, I support them always
Latin doesn’t say wapentake at clause




Misc differeences
O’Brien says translator introduced ambiguity and lack of precision (‘Translating technical terms, p.68, fn 35)
Maybe refers to places like 1.5: OE says that reeves will lose king’s friendship and forfeit all if they don’t punish non-payers – Latin says that all great men should devote themselves with fierce severity to subdue those who endeavour to violate… etr
Renders ‘rights/dues of God’ as ‘this decree’ in 1.6
‘servants of God who receive those goods/wealth [sceattas] we give to God’ is made pretty unclear as ‘ministers…into whose hands we pass what we give to the Lord of universes’ 1.7
Liebermann says translator mistook a rural headman for a landlord (IV Eg 1.4)
And says they added false info, pompous embellishment 

More cross-references in lat (7, 10)
IV Eg 6: ‘usus necessitatis’ – used by Augustine, Alcuin (from Augustine), but also Codex Theodosianus [see research notebook p. 232]
‘in seculo militans’ for ‘geneatmanna’
1.5a is left out – possibly because it’s hard to understand? Something seems off about the OE
2.1/2.1a Latin removes reference to adding to laws of elders
Changes ‘I and my witan’ to ‘I’ with emphasis from using ‘equidem’
