Summary: Tracing the sources for an unexplained translation in the biblical prologue to Alfred's laws


This was originally submitted to <i>Notes & Queries</i>, but after something like 18 months of faff (not just on their end), I decided it wasn’t worth it – the contribution is tiny! But maybe it’ll be useful to someone at some point. And it could be helpful as an overview of the early sources to the common motif of judges being influenced by fear, favour and greed in their judgements (though I could never quite get the structure of the article right and so it does present these sources in a slightly unintuitive way). Anyway!


<h2>A POSSIBLE SOURCE USED IN THE PROLOGUE TO KING ALFRED’S LAW-CODE</h2>


The translator responsible for rendering several chapters of Exodus into Old English for the prologue to the law-code of King Alfred of Wessex (r. 871–99) kept reasonably close to the Latin original. Some changes were made to syntax, phrasing and occasionally penalties or legal procedures, but it is never in doubt that we are reading a translation of parts of Exodus 20–23. However, one passage bears so little resemblance to the direct source of the surrounding material that it can’t be called a translation. The passage in question reads [^1] 

> Dem ðu swiðe emne. Ne dem ðu oðerne dom þam welegan, oðerne ðam earman, ne oðerne þam liofran 7 oðerne þam laðran ne dem ðu.
>
> Judge very justly. Do not judge one judgement for the rich, another for the poor; do not judge one for one you love and another one you hate. 

[^1]: Original text from S. Jurasinski and L. Oliver, <i>The Laws of Alfred: The Domboc and the Making of Anglo-Saxon Law</i> (Cambridge, 2021), 258. Translation is my own.

Given the surrounding verses, it ought to be a translation of Exodus 23:6: ‘Non declinabis in judicium pauperis’, ‘Do not go aside in the poor man’s judgment’ or Exodus 23:3 ‘Pauperis quoque non misereberis in judicio’, ‘Neither shall you favour a poor man in judgment’.[^2]

[^2]: It is preceded by a translation of Exodus 23:1, 23:2 and 23:4 and followed by Exodus 23:7 and 23:8. 

The passage in the law-code is not drawn from elsewhere in the Bible, nor can the rewriting be explained by the logic underlying the other – less radical – alterations made to the biblical text.[^3]

[^3]: For other adjustments in the biblical translation, see P. Wormald, <i>The Making of English Law: King Alfred to the twelfth century. Vol. 1, Legislation and its limits</i> (Oxford, 1999), 420–3; D. Pratt, <i>The Political Thought of King Alfred</i> (Cambridge, 2007), 230–2; K. Carella, ‘The Source of the Prologue to the Laws of Alfred’, <i>Peritia</i> xix (2005), 91–118; I. Ivarsen, ‘The Production of the Anglo-Saxon Laws from Alfred to Cnut’, (unpublished PhD thesis, University of St Andrews, 2020), 123–32. 

The idea that justice could be undermined was relatively common in the early Middle Ages and there was a textual tradition of expressing the causes of injustice through opposing pairs: love and hate, fear and favour, poverty and riches, friend and foe. This motif is found in, for instance, Isidore of Seville’s Sententiae and in early medieval continental legislation. Finding analogues to the passage in Alfred’s prologue is therefore not difficult, and, as we’ll see below, there are several texts through which this motif could have reached Anglo-Saxon royal courts. However, the direct source for Alfred’s prologue is likely to be a psalm commentary, the only text which can account both for this particular framing of injustice and for why it was considered a suitable replacement for Exodus 23:3/6. I’ll start by introducing these. 

There are two, closely related, psalm commentaries which may have been used as direct sources for the prologue: the seventh-century Frankish Glosa psalmorum ex traditione seniorum and a slightly later, possibly Irish commentary Breviarium in psalmos (Pseudo-Jerome). Both may have been used for the Old English translation of the first fifty psalms, a text which is believed to have come from Alfred’s court.[^4]

[^4]: P. O’Neill, <i>King Alfred’s Old English Prose Translation of the First Fifty Psalms</i> (Cambridge, MA, 2001), 35–6, 44 (on sources), 94–5 (on authorship). O’Neill points (p. 169) out another parallel between the prologue to the law-code and a passage in the Old English psalms where Glosa may have been used as a source.Both offer the same commentary on Psalm 32:5:[^5]

[^5]:   It’s possible that they draw on Isidore’s Sententiae for this commentary, which may also therefore be a possible source for Alfred. However, Isidore’s phrasing is different enough that I consider the psalm commentaries as more likely sources. Isidore explained Ex 23:3 in the following way: ‘Qui enim consanguinitatis uel amicitiae fauore, siue inimicitiarum odio, iudicium peruertunt, sine dubio in Christum, qui est ueritas et iustitia, peccare noscuntur’ (Isidore, Sententiae, III:53.1, ed. Caziel, 308). ‘The one who perverts his judgment out of favor to family or friendship, or out of hatred of his enemies, without doubt knows how to sin against Christ, who is truth and justice’; translation from Isidore, Sententiae, trans. Knoebel, 206.

>Quomodo dicit: diligit misericordiam, cum alio loco dicat: Ne miserearis pauperi in iudicio? id est non propter pauperem nec propter diuitem, non propter proximum et longinquum, non propter cognitum et incognitum: non declines a recto iudicio.[^6]  
>
>How does it say: he loved mercy [Ps 32:5], since it says in another place: you should not favour a poor man in judgment [Ex 23:3/6]? That is, neither for the sake of a poor man nor a rich man, not for the sake of a kinsman or a stranger, nor for the sake of someone you know and someone you don’t; do not divert from just judgment.
