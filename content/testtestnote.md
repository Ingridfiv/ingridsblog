Summary: Does Old English letters work?

The translator responsible for rendering several chapters of Exodus into Old English for the prologue to the law-code of King Alfred of Wessex (r. 871–99) kept reasonably close to the Latin original. Some changes were made to syntax, phrasing and occasionally penalties or legal procedures, but it is never in doubt that we are reading a translation of parts of Exodus 20–23. However, one passage bears so little resemblance to the direct source of the surrounding material that it can’t be called a translation. The passage in question reads: 

Dem ðu swiðe emne. Ne dem ðu oðerne dom þam welegan, oðerne ðam earman, ne oðerne þam liofran 7 oðerne þam laðran ne dem ðu.

Judge very justly. Do not judge one judgement for the rich, another for the poor; do not judge one for one you love and another one you hate.  

Given the surrounding verses, it ought to be a translation of Exodus 23:6: ‘Non declinabis in judicium pauperis’, ‘Do not go aside in the poor man’s judgment’ or Exodus 23:3 ‘Pauperis quoque non misereberis in judicio’, ‘Neither shall you favour a poor man in judgment’.
